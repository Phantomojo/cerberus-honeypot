The Cowrie config needs to include "ssh_version_string" field in the [shell] section.

Current code has:
    "version = %s\n"

Should also include in the [shell] section:
    "ssh_version_string = %s\n"

This is at line ~294 in src/morph/morph.c, in the [shell] section configuration.

To fix: Add after the "hostname = %s\n" line:
        "ssh_version_string = %s\n"

And update the snprintf arguments to include:
        profile->ssh_banner,
