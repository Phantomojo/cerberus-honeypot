                        KEY CONCEPT SUMMARY
================================================================================

CERBERUS in 3 sentences:
  CERBERUS solves honeypot detection by rotating through 6 realistic IoT
  devices, regenerating all 6 layers of device identity (network, filesystem,
  processes, behavior, temporal, quorum) simultaneously every 6-24 hours.
  Attackers can't use static fingerprints because the device changes faster
  than they can adapt.

The Rubik's Cube:
  - 6 faces = 6 device profiles
  - 6 layers = 6 morphing phases
  - When it rotates = all layers of active face change together

The Result:
  - Detection rate: 95% → 30% (65 point improvement!)
  - Engagement: 2-3 min → 8-15 min (5x longer!)

Why It's Ingenious:
  Coordinates 6 layers changing together faster than attacker can adapt.
