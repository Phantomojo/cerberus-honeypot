# 🚀 Installation Guide: The Golden Path

Follow these steps to deploy the CERBERUS Bio-Adaptive Honeynet.

## 1. Prerequisites
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (Latest version)
- **C Compiler** (gcc/clang) for morphing engine
- **Python 3.8+** (for dynamic script support)

## 2. Quick Start (Automated)
Run the setup script to initialize the environment, build C modules, and prepare the services:
```bash
./setup.sh --install-deps  # Installs system dependencies
./setup.sh                # Builds C components and sets up venv
```

## 3. Configuration
The morphing engine uses `profiles.conf` (or default profiles) to rotate device identities.
- Ensure `services/cowrie/etc/cowrie.cfg` is ready (it will be auto-generated by the engine).

## 4. Deployment
Start the entire honeynet using Docker Compose:
```bash
cd docker
docker compose up -d
```

## 5. Autonomous Harvesting (Optional)
To populate the identity library with live real-world targets, use the **AIA Engine** with your Shodan session cookie:
```bash
python3 scripts/shodan_autonomous.py --cookie "YOUR_POLITO_COOKIE" --pages 2
```

## 6. Verification
Check if the services are running and the morphing engine is active:
```bash
docker compose ps
tail -f logs/cerberus.log
```

> [!TIP]
> **Admin Access:** If you need to SSH into the host, move your host's sshd to port 2222 or similar, as CERBERUS will take over port 22 for maximum deception.
